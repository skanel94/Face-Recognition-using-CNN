# Description

In the context of my Bachelor's thesis I implemented in python a Face Recognition system. The libraries that have been used are:
* keras
* sklearn
* numpy
* pandas
* dlib
* matplotlib
and  more.

From the networks that have been used, InceptionV3 presented the best results achieving 97.22% accuracy.
